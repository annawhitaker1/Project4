## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a predictive model to determine loan approval statuses using a dataset sourced from Kaggle. The dataset includes various features related to applicants' demographics, financial information, and loan details.

## Dataset

- **Source:** [Kaggle Loan Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/)
- **Potential Challenges:**
  - Missing values
  - Imbalanced target variable
  - Categorical data requiring encoding

## Data Cleaning

- Filled missing values
- Mapped categorical variables to numerical values
- Updated data types as necessary

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- **Comparative Analyses:**
  - Loan Amount per Property Area
  - Loan Amount per Marital Status
- **Additional Analyses:**
  - Balance of target variable
  - Outlier detection
  - Feature interactions with target variable

## Model Development

- Defined features and target variable
- Split data into training and testing sets
- Standardized feature variables
- Trained the model

## Model Performance

- **Accuracy:** 0.79

## Model Adjustments

- Explored the impact of various adjustments on model accuracy

## Conclusion

The project successfully developed a loan approval prediction model with an accuracy of 79%. Future improvements could focus on addressing data imbalances and exploring advanced modeling techniques to enhance performance.
